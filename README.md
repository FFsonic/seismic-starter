# Walnut Starter Contracts

![walnut banner](assets/walnut_banner.png)

### Overview
A good example to get you started with using `stype`. The app is centered around
a walnut with a secret number inside. 

Every time you shake the walnut, this number increments. Every time you hit the 
walnut, the shell gets closer to cracking. You can only look at the number once 
the shell is cracked.

### Usage
Run the following command to run the tests:
```bash
$ sforge test
```

### Coming up
We'll extend this starter repository to include a mobile interface for the
walnut that runs on a local `sanvil` instance. The ETA for this is Dec 16, 2024.

Then we'll release a version that deploys to the seismic devnet. The ETA for
this is Dec 23, 2024.
